In React Native, an uncommon bug can occur when using the `FlatList` component with a large dataset and complex item rendering.  The issue manifests as seemingly random crashes or freezes, particularly on lower-end devices. This isn't due to a single, easily identifiable error message, but rather performance degradation leading to instability. The root cause often lies in inefficient rendering or excessive re-renders within the individual list items.
